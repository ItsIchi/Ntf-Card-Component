### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

## My process
  -Started planning by sketching out the basic layout with the differnt parts before coding any HTML.
  -Went with a Mobile first approach for the first time and focused on getting things to scale as close to design as possible.
  -Moved from top to bottom making sure to capture small details after getting all elements in proper place in reference to eachother.
  -Finally focused on making sure everything would function as expected in reference to responsiveness, adding any active and hover state effects last.
### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

-Comfort with CSS
-Familarizing with img overlays and hover states more so with Jpgs 
-Relationships between divs in relationship with childern as far as sizing and positioning goes as well as display.
